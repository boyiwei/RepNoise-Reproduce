This dataset is filtered from Beavertails-330k-train + Beavertails-330k-test (they are actually not the "train" set and "test" set, just a two subset from Beavertails-330k). We select the elements that are not appeared in the beavertails_with_refusals_train.json to make sure there's no overlap between the ft dataset and the the dataset for training with repnoise. Also, we choose the majority preference to determine whether the example is safe or not, instead of directly looking into the 'is_safe' label.
